# Realtime-face-recognition-based-attendance-management-app-using-matlab
This project is a face recognition-based attendance marking system developed using MATLAB. It utilizes machine learning techniques with a pre-trained AlexNet model to detect and recognize faces from webcam input. Recognized individuals are marked as "present," and an attendance sheet is generated automatically. The system includes:

Data Storage: Capturing and storing face images from video input.
Training Model: Using deep learning (AlexNet) for facial recognition.
Testing Model: Identifying individuals and marking attendance.
GUI (App Designer): A user-friendly interface for real-time attendance marking.
